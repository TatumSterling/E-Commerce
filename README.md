## Description
Hello, My name is Tatum Sterling, and welcome to my backend e-commerce application. This application utilizes MYSQL, Javascript, sequelize, and express.js to create a relational database with functioning api routes for products, tags, and categories of merchandise.
        
## Installation
```
npm init
```
```
npm i
```
        
## Usage
After cloning this repo and running the above commands in the CLI, you can go to the db folder and run 
```
mysql -u root -p
```
then
```
source schema.sql
```
then you may go into the server.js in the command line and run 
```
npm run seed
```
this will seed your database with the necessary information to start using your api routes. 

You may watch a walkthrough of these commands in this video:

With this code, you can recieve all or single item data from the models. You may also create, update and delete these items using the api routes.
